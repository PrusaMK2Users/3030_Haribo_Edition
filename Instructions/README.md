# Instructions

## Important measurements

The only one that you need to worry about is the spacing of the left y rod holders.

On the reference build, each left y rod holder is 67.75mm from the edge of the extrusion.

Ensure the front and back measurements of the left side are the same.  Then using the the bearings and the y carriage, ensure the right side y rods are parallel and the y carriage ride smoothly.  if needed adjust position of the bearing holders so that the y carriage slides smooth.

## Guidelines

- build on a level hard surface and ensure the frame is square as you tighten the frame bolts.
- when installing the frame braces, tighten them but don't go hulk strength and crack them.
- I found fender washer for the y carriage bolts spread the load and help maintain consistent contact
- make sure you use the correct length M6 screws, most pieces use M6 x 12 but others use M6 x 14, 
  - M6 x 12mm screws should be used for the parts that have recessed holes. Namely: Y idler and motor holder, the Rambo mount
  holder and the Z Rod Holders
  - M6 x 14mm screws with washer should be used on L and T brackets
- the firmware changes are optional. you can make this work without making any changes by moving the gantry so tha the nozzle is 210mm from the print bed
