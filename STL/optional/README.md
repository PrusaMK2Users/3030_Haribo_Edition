|1x 67.75mm Jig.stl|jtktam|A jig to set the spacing of the left y rod holders to 67.75mm.  don't worry if it's not dead on, the idea is using this will ensure the front and back *LEFT* side y rod holders are the same distance from the left edge of the extrusion.  the holes are for M6 x 12 bolts and t-nuts, it's *suppose* to be loose so you can slide it in and out quickly.  Tested and it works to ensure the left side is good to go|
