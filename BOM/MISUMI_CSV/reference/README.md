# Introduction
Regardless of whether you are upgrading from an existing Original Prusa i3 MK2,
or building a 3030 Haribo Edition from scratch, you will need to order aluminum
extrusions, smooth rods, t-slot nuts. Our current recommended source for these
parts (for those living in the US) is from (Misumi USA)[https://www.misumi-ec.com/us].

To make the Misumi ordering process simpler, we have put together a CSV (Comma-separated Value) file containing all of the parts for the 3030 Haribo Edition. This file can be uploaded to your Misumi cart using the instructinos below.

# 1. Pick your color!
Decide whether you would like a silver frame or a black frame. Choose a color and then download the appropriate corresponding CSV file below based on your selection.

- (Silver)[./Misumi_Haribo_Upgrade_Parts_Silver.csv]
- (Black)[./Misumi_Haribo_Upgrade_Parts_Black.csv]

# 2. Do you also want an integrated spool holder?
If you would like to also build a spool holder, you can also download a CSV file containing those additional parts below:

- (Silver)[./Misumi_Haribo_SpoolHolder_Silver.csv]
- (Black)[./Misumi_Haribo_SpoolHolder_Black.csv]

# 3. Order the parts!

- **Step 5**. On the "Import From File", select "Choose File" and select the CSV for the main Haribo parts that you previously downloaded. This file should begin in "Misumi_Haribo_Upgrade_Parts_". If you also downloaded the spool holder CSV, repeat this process once you have finished importing the first CSV file by returning to Step 4.
