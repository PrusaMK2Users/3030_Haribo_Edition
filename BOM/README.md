# I. Intro
Below you will find the Bill of Materials for the 3030 Haribo Edition build. This list of materials is mostly complete, but it is still a work in progress. Please join our [Slack](http://codehemi.com) group and join the #haribo3030 channel if you have any questions at all.

# II. 3030 Frame Parts
Whether you are upgrading your existing Original Prusa i3 MK2 or building a 3030 Haribo Edition from scratch,
there are some aluminum extrusion parts that you will need. If you live in the United States, see our [CSV guide here](./MISUMI_CSV/README.md) to download a pre-made list of parts to upload and order straight from [Misumi US](https://us.misumi-ec.com/).

## Reference Parts List
If you would rather source the frame parts elsewhere, below is a list of all of the frame parts you will need and their part numbers from [Misumi US](https://us.misumi-ec.com/).

# IV. Bushings (OPTIONAL)
If you are upgrading from an Original Prusa i3 MK2, you may re-use the LM8UU bushings for X, Y and Z axes. However, you may consider swapping the X and Y axes with IGUS Drylin bushings. You can find the quantity and description below.

- if you use the mk1-> mk2 upgrade kit you will need to get the above, otherwise you can reuse from the mk2 kit
- I would consider ferrules __essential__ to ensure the wires are properly terminated for the power blocks

- M6x12mm screws should be used for the parts that have recessed holes.  Namely: Y idler and motor holder, the Rambo mount holder and the Z Rod Holders
- most places sell hardware in packs of 50 or 100.. for most of these you might as well get them in bulk
- the y carriage is any standard square type that you can get for a generic prusa i3
- the 5x16 shaft can be found in lots of RC off road buggies

## "Missing bits"

- if you used the mk1->mk2 upgrade kit, you will find that you are missing a whole bunch of stuff Prusa assume you will reuse from your non-existant mk1
- this is where I will be documenting the missing bits *I* used .. you can always substitute your own ideas
