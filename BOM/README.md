# I. Introduction
Below you will find the Bill of Materials for the **3030 Haribo Edition** build. This BOM will help you to either **upgrade** your **Original Prusa i3 MK2** or **scratch-build** a printer. Each section contains a subheading to indicate if it's required for an **upgrade** or just a **scratch-build**. If you have questions about this build, feel free to submit a Github issue and we will be glad to help you.

# II. Aluminum Frame Parts / Smooth Rods / Rubber Feet
#### Required For: **Upgrade** / **Scratch-Build**
This section contains the frame parts, smooth rods, t-slot nuts, and rubber feet that you will need.

If you live in the United States, the recommended seller of these parts is [Misumi US](https://us.misumi-ec.com/). To simplify the ordering process from Misumi, we have created a [Misumi CSV guide here](./MISUMI_CSV/README.md). You can simply download a pre-made data file and upload it to your cart to order all of the required parts.

If you would rather source the frame parts elsewhere, below is a list of all of the frame parts you will need.

# IV. Bushings
If you are upgrading from an Original Prusa i3 MK2, you may re-use the **LM8UU** bushings for X, Y and Z axes. However, you may consider swapping the X and Y axes with IGUS Drylin® Bushings. **Caution**: It is NOT recommended to use these bushings on the Z axis, as it is prone to binding on the **3030 Haribo Edition**.
